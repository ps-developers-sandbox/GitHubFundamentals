# üî® Hands-on: working with Issues

In this hands-on lab, you will practice working with nested Issues, Labels, Milestones, and Issue Templates. 

The lab contains the following sections:
- [üî® Hands-on: working with Issues](#-hands-on-working-with-issues)
  - [Creating Issues](#creating-issues)
  - [Milestones](#milestones)
  - [Issue templates](#issue-templates)
  - [Summary](#summary)

## Creating Issues

- [ ] Create a [new issue](../../../issues/new) called `üèÜ Awesome and epic initiative from [username]` (replace [username] with your GitHub user name).
- [ ] Assign the issue to yourself
- [ ] Apply a label `Epic` to the issue (create the label if it does not exist yet)
- [ ] Add a task list with three tasks to the description of the epic
  - [ ] `üé∏ A feature from [username] that rocks`
  - [ ] `‚ö° Another epic feature from [username]`
  - [ ] `üî• Hot feature from [username]`
- [ ] Convert the tasks to issues

- [ ] Open the issues, assign them to yourself, and apply the label `Feature` (create the label if it does not exist yet)
- [ ] Select one of the issues and open it. Add again three tasks and convert them to new issues:
  - [ ] `üë• User Story from [username]`
  - [ ] `‚ù§Ô∏è Things users ‚ù§Ô∏è from [username]`
  - [ ] `üíØ Crazy feature from [username]`

> **Note**  
> Note that the task list of nested issues has to be in the description - not a comment. Edit the first entry in the Issue instead of adding a new comment.

 - [ ] Open the created issues, assign them to yourself, and apply the label `User Story` (create the label if it does not exist yet)

## Milestones

- [ ] Create [a new milestone](../../../milestones/new) `Backlog [username]` without due date and add all your user stories

- [ ] Use drag and drop to sort the user stories for the milestone and use <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> or <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> to move items with the keyboard. Note the progression through the closed user story.

## Issue templates

- [ ] Create [a new issue template](../../../issues/templates/edit) and choose bug report or just create a [new file](../../new/main) `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report_[username].md` (replace [username] with your GitHub user name)
- [ ] Open the file or `preview and edit`and make sure the filename contains your user name.

- [ ] Adjust the meta data to contain your name, a title, a label, and an assignee:

```yaml
---
name: üêû Bug report wulfland
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: '[Bug]:'
labels: 'bug'
assignees: 'wulfland'

---

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

...
```

- [ ] Create [a new issue](../../../issues/new/choose) and chose your template:

- [ ] Note the pre-filled data:

- __Optional:__ Only if time permits: create a custom issue template. See [this template](https://github.com/wulfland/AccelerateDevOps/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/custom.yml) as an example. Also configure that blank issues are not allowed and add an additional URL to the `New issue` dialog ([this example](https://github.com/wulfland/AccelerateDevOps/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml) should help you getting started).
