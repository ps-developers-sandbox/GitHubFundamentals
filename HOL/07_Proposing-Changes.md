# ðŸ”¨ Hands-on: Proposing changes

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to propose changes to files using using pull-requests. 
The exercise consists of the following parts:
- [Editing in GitHub](#editing-in-github)
- [Branches](#branches)
- [Creating a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request)

## Editing in GitHub

GitHub has a built-in editor that allows you to edit files inline. Use the editor to create a new file.

- [ ] Create a [new file](../../../new/main) `docs/_slides/[username].md` (Just paste the entire path the the name field).

---

Greetings from [username]!

## Branches

- [ ] You can directly add the new file to a new branch `[username]-slide` (replace [username] with your GitHub user name).

## Creating a pull request

- [ ] Create a `draft` pull request. Note that the base branch is main and your `HEAD` branch the newly created branch. Assign the pull request to yourself.
